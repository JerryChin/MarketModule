# MarketModule
An exhaustive implementation of e-commerce site, it will be time-saving for start-ups. `MarketModuleBG` serves as the backend of this project. =.=

An overwhelming number of tasks from the company, a stupid manager asked me to write like 100+ interfaces, ironically most of them are deprecated.

filthily dealing with UI designers. hope someone have time to help grow this project.

I will keep contributing too.

Thanks.

some mainstream frameworks adopted in the project, plus NDK.
I was ready to put URL in NDK, then injected by JNI, but the other day I found it cumbersome, so plan aborted. it's stacked in Java layer.

Guys from GH, pray for strength for me!
